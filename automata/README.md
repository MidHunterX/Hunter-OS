![iris](./.assets/auto_adaptation.jpg)

Maintains the contrast of a transparent window across different wallpapers;
doesn't matter if the wallpaper is dark or light, the window will have the same
perceived opacity. It does this by dynamically adjusting the brightness of
the window based on the perceived brightness of the current wallpaper.
Similar to how your eyes adapt to different light conditions.
