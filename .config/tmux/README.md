# 🍱 TMUX (Terminal Multiplexer)

![TMUX](./.assets/tmux.jpg)

tmux is an open-source terminal multiplexer for Unix-like operating systems. It
allows multiple terminal sessions to be accessed simultaneously in a single
window. It is useful for running more than one command-line program at the same
time. It can also be used to detach processes from their controlling terminals,
allowing remote sessions to remain active without being visible.

## Negatives

> Doesn't recognize many ctrl sequences

Most terminal apps can only recognize the following ctrl chars:

- `Ctrl-A` .. `Ctrl-Z`
- `Ctrl-@` `Ctrl-[` `Ctrl-\` `Ctrl-]` `Ctrl-^` `Ctrl-_`

and they cannot tell the difference between, for example, `Ctrl-i` and `Tab`,
`Ctrl-M` and `Enter`, `Ctr-[` and `Esc`, ... (more details
[here](https://www.leonerd.org.uk/hacks/fixterms/)).

Nvim uses [libtermkey](https://www.leonerd.org.uk/code/libtermkey/) which can
recognize more ctrl sequences but for tmux, `Ctrl-=` is the same as `=` so tmux
just forwards = to nvim.

Which means.. many keybindings won't work when using nvim with tmux.
