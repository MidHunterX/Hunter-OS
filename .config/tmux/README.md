# üç± TMUX (Terminal Multiplexer)

![TMUX](./assets/tmux.jpg)

tmux is an open-source terminal multiplexer for Unix-like operating systems. It
allows multiple terminal sessions to be accessed simultaneously in a single
window. It is useful for running more than one command-line program at the same
time. It can also be used to detach processes from their controlling terminals,
allowing remote sessions to remain active without being visible.
