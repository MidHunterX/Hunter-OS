# üÜö Code OSS (Code Editor)

![VS Code](./.assets/code.jpg)

Code - OSS is an open source project without any proprietary code under the MIT License.
The main problem with VSCode is that, it has no context aware keybindings by default for the keyboard people in the year of 2020.
keybindings.json contains a list of context aware keybindings that I have used during my time in VSCode. <br>
It also fixes some vim extension key conflicts in order to use the default VSCode keybindings on insert mode and Vim keybindings on normal mode.

## ‚ùå Problems
- It puts dotfiles on $HOME dir which doesn't follow XDG Spec. [VSCode Issue has been open since 2016](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/3884)
- This problem is inherited from Electron, which is inherited from Chrome.
- Electron has has an issue for this: [ electron/electron#8124 ]( https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/8124 ). They seem to be worried about breaking backwards compatibility for every program that uses Electron.
- VSCode is also creating `~/.pki/nssdb` even though NSS has supported XDG since version 3.42
