# ðŸ¦Š Firefox (Web Browser)

Because... monopoly have never been a good thing to be honest (except for the company ofc).

And this seems to be the least broken browser out there in the market.

Features:
- Icon only tabs - That's the only information I need though. How many tabs there are.
- Distinctive theming for different profiles to reflect the type of usage.
- Used oneBar as base because... "Dig out the best stuff and improve upon it"
- Hardened with Arkenfox js

Personally I use these extensions:

- **uBlock Origin** (Have never been a fan of ads)
- **Vimium C** (Better contrast in tags by default)
- **Dark Reader** (Welcome to the dark side)

# Problems With Firefox

- `.mozilla` in $HOME, not following Freedesktop XDG Base Directory Specification
- Slow development
- Features and Open Issues stays on for Milleniums
- Even though customizable, it has many design limitations
- Tougher to implement vertical tabs natively
