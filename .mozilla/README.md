# ðŸ¦Š Firefox (Web Browser)

Because... monopoly have never been a good thing to be honest (except for the company ofc).

And this seems to be the least broken browser out there in the market.

## Problems

- ~Cannot use ESC to deselect url bar. [Bug Report](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1086524) opened 10 years ago but still not solved.~
> Happy news for Vimmers, this got fixed in 2024... on it's 10th anniversary ðŸŽ‰
- `.mozilla` in $HOME, not following Freedesktop XDG Base Directory Specification
- Features and Open Issues stays on for Milleniums
- Even though customizable, it has many design limitations
- Tougher to implement vertical tabs natively

## Features:
- Icon only tabs - That's the only information I need though. How many tabs there are.
- Distinctive theming for different profiles to reflect the type of usage.
- Used oneBar as base because... "Dig out the best stuff and improve upon it"
- Hardened with Arkenfox js

Personally I use these extensions:

- **uBlock Origin** (Have never been a fan of ads)
- **Vimium C** (Better contrast in tags by default)
- **Dark Reader** (Welcome to the dark side)
