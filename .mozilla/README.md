Because... monopoly have never been a good thing to be honest (except for the company ofc).

Features:
- Icon only tabs - That's the only information I need though. How many tabs there are.
- Distinctive theming for different profiles to reflect the type of usage.
- Used oneBar as base because... "Dig out the best stuff and improve upon it"

Personally I use these extensions:

- **uBlock Origin** (Have never been a fan of ads)
- **Vimium C** (Better contrast in tags by default)
- **Dark Reader** (Welcome to the dark side)
