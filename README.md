## üéπ System Wide Key Remaps (keyd)

Linux lacks a good key remapping solution. In order to achieve satisfactory results a medley of tools need to be employed (e.g xcape, xmodmap) with the end result often being tethered to a specified environment (X11). keyd attempts to solve this problem by providing a flexible system wide daemon which remaps keys using kernel level input primitives (evdev, uinput).

| Remap            | Output Key             |
| ---------------- | ---------------------- |
| Space + h        | Left                   |

| Space + k        | Up                     |
| Space + l        | Right                  |
| Space + w        | Move One Word Forward  |
| Space + b        | Move One Word Backward |
| f j              | Esc                    |
